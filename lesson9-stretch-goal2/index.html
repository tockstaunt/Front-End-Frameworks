<!-- Leverage your knowledge of Bootstrap to create a web page that contains the following:

    Nav bar
        At least four nav tabs/pills
        At least one of those should be a drop-down menu
        Add a Search box for the nav bar that includes a glyphicon
    Reuse the form and table that you built.
    Align the table and form next to one another using the grid system
    At least three Bootstrap buttons with different colors (primary, danger, etc...)
    Give your page some styling using CSS (color, font, etc..)
    Use the Bootstrap Grid Layout to align your navbar and form.
